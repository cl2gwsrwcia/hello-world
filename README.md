# hello-world
I want to contribute while I learn. This is where things start.
I am a middle-aged civil engineer who has dabbled in programming for many years now. I started programming on the HP-25 scientific calculator as a child and went on to learning some Basic. In college I took an introductory class on Pascal. I learned how to use VBA and VB and wrote a simple program to calculate various hydraulic properties of stormwater culverts. I also learned a little ArcView Avenue script and subsequently spent a decent amount of time learning Python. I have tried out a little JavaScript as well.

I am interested in learning how to be a better coder and in contributing my tiny bit to the community at large. I think it will help me to spend a good bit of time seeing how other people do things.
